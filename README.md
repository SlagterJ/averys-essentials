Hi, this is Avery's Essentials, a modpack I've made that meets all of my personal necessities because no other modpack could.
It includes performance mods, Optifine replacement mods and technical mods.

It also includes No Chat Reports which protects you from global bans where possible.

You can download the pack via Modrinth.

## FAQ

- **Q** What does bleeding-edge mean?
- **A** _It means that Avery's Essentials does comparatively less testing on updates than
  other modpacks do, this leads to it possibly being less stable but more up-to-date._

- **Q** What does rolling release mean?
- **A** _Most minecraft modpacks are released on a stable basis, meaning that you get
  updates less often but they are bigger and more stable. Avery's Essentials is built on
  a rolling release model, meaning that as soon as changes happen that aren't breaking they
  get released, which leads to smaller updates more often, that are less likely to break
  your existing configuration._

- **Q** Can I build off of this pack?
- **A** _Yes you can, do as you please._

- **Q** What is this project licensed under?
- **A** _It's MIT licensed._
